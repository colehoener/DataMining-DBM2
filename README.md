# DataMining-DBM2
Final project for DBM2 at INSA Lyon

***

For our project did we pick the <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Stock Markets 1871-Present and CAPE Ratio</a> data from Robert Shiller. 
The data set consists of monthly stock price, dividends, and earnings data and the consumer price index. It also includes the Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which is used to analyze a company's long-term financial performance. An extremly high value could signal that a company or stock is over-valued (vice versa for low values). In the past, the CAPE ratio could identify potential bubbles or market crashes.

Open the 'Final_version' to see our final analysis and interpretation.
